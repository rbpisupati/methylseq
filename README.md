nf-core/methylseq is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for Methylation (Bisulfite) sequencing data. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

The pipeline allows you to choose between running either [Bismark](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark) or [bwa-meth](https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth) / [MethylDackel](https://github.com/dpryan79/methyldackel).
Choose between workflows by using `--aligner bismark` (default, uses bowtie2 for alignment), `--aligner bismark_hisat` or `--aligner bwameth`.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility (please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))

Since, methylpy is only added in conda environment file. Please use conda installation.
```bash 
conda env create -f methylseq/environment.yml
```

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/methylseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
```

> Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

iv. Start running your own analysis!

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/methylseq -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --reads '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh37
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.
